For documenting your code, you may chose to take several different approaches! It can also be influenced by the structure of what you are working on!

For example, things in the database may be categorized into subgroups and related queries - whereas the front end might be groped by components! All in all they should aim to include these things:

### Table of Contents
- [`Table of Contents`](#table-of-contents)
- [`Overview`](#high-level-overview)
- [`Classes`](#class-by-class)
- [`Methods`](#method-by-method)


Especially as your project grows, it may make sense to include a table of ns rticontents to link to different significant portions of the code! This can be easilly done using the hyperlink to header, like so:

```
[`Name`](#link-to-header)
```

Here we've added the backticks around the name value for a button like style! The table of contents should subdivide into appropriate levels, for some you may choose dividing by classes and creating an overview, for others you may want to document and categorize methods - you can also do both!

### High Level Overview

The high level overview should ideally contain any doagrams you've made for this portion of the code (Workflows, context diagrams etc.) along with clarifying information that may have been present in chats/ planning etc.

### Class by Class

Class by class division should include:

#### Class Name

> A general description of the class and its functionality

Next, list brief descritions of the contained methods and class level variables

### Method by Method

> Should include a description of each method and what it does, along with what its parameters are and what values it should return.

Do these methods have any measures for security? Other info etc. etc.
